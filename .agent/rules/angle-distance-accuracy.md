when using radian angles like pi,pi/2 always use precision of 4 decimal points. also when calculating distances as doubles keep with accuracy of at least 5 decimal points. double check the code and inform me about given distance/angle doubles that has no accuracy more than this distances. when i ask to fix dont just round up but ask relevant follow up questions , but ask a minimum amount of questions as necessary
