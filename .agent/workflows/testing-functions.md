description: create all the functions and codes inside the testingfunctions.h
---

when this workflow called implement all the functions and code  inside the testingfunctions.h do not effect any other file , always look to improve accuracy and make changes that doesnt trade off accuracy for any other thing.make sure the function and the logic doesnt effect and corrupt the logic in motioncontroller.h, analyize the motioncontrollerh and use outputs of pid controllers and help of  other functions in it.the functions made in this parts will be tested in main.cpp and then later moved to movingcontroller h and deleted from testingfunctions.h-(but only when the user sayed so)
